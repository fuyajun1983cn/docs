<p>
The Bluetooth logical link control and
adaptation protocol (L2CAP) supports
higher level protocol <b>multiplexing</b>,
<b>packet segmentation</b> and <b>reassembly</b>,
and the conveying of quality of service
information. The protocol state
machine, packet format, and
composition are described in this
document.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
L2CAP provides connectionoriented and connectionless data services
to upper layer protocols with protocol multiplexing capability and
segmentation and reassembly operation.
</p>

<p>
Upper layer data packets (L2CAP Service Data Units, SDU) is up to 64
kilobytes in length. 
</p>

<p>
L2CAP also permits per-channel flow control and retransmission.
</p>

<p>
The L2CAP layer provides logical channels, named L2CAP channels, which
are multiplexed over one or more logical links.

<h4 id="sec-2-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1</span> Protocol/channel multiplexing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
An L2CAP channel shall operate over one Controller at a
time. During channel setup, protocol multiplexing capability is
used to route the connection to the correct upper layer protocol. 
</p>

<p>
For data transfer, logical channel multiplexing is needed.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.2</span> Segmentation and reassembly</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
This provides the following benefits:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Segmentation will allow the interleaving of application data
units in order to satisfy latency requirements.
</li>
<li>Memory and buffer management is easier when L2CAP controls the packet size.
</li>
<li>Error correction by retransmission can be made more efficient.
</li>
<li>The amount of data that is destroyed when an L2CAP PDU is
corrupted or lost can be made smaller than the application's
data unit.
</li>
<li>The application is decoupled from the segmentation required to
map the application packets into the lower layer packets.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sec-2-1-3"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.3</span> Flow control per L2CAP channel</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3">
<p>
Controllers provide error and flow control for data going over the air and HCI
flow control exists for data going over an HCI transport. When several data
streams run over the same Controller using separate L2CAP channels, each
channel requires individual flow control. A window based flow control
scheme is provided.

Streaming applications such as audio set up an L2CAP channel with an
agreed-upon data rate。 don't use flow control mechanisms in L2CAP

<p>
During transmission of an L2CAP PDU, many different levels of
fragmentation and recombination may occur in both peer devices.
</p>

<p>
However the PDU is fragmented within the stack, the
receiving L2CAP entity still recombines the fragments to obtain the original
L2CAP PDU.

<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> ASSUMPTIONS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The protocol is designed based on the following assumptions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Controllers provide orderly delivery of data packets, although
there might be individual packet corruption and duplicates.
</li>
<li>Controllers always provide the impression of full-duplex
communication channels. This does not imply that all L2CAP
communications are bidirectional. Unidirectional traffic does
not require duplex channels.
</li>
<li>The L2CAP layer provides a channel with a degree of reliability
based on the mechanisms available in Controllers and with
additional packet segmentation, error detection, and
retransmission that can be enabled in the enhanced L2CAP layer.
</li>
<li>Controllers provide error and flow control for data going over
the air and HCI flow control exists for data going over an HCI
transport. It has four modes to provide different level of flow
control requirements. The Flow and Error Control block provides four modes:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enhanced Retransmission mode
offer segmentation, flow control and L2CAP PDU retransmissions.
</li>
<li>Retransmission Mode
offer segmentation, flow control and L2CAP PDU retransmissions.
</li>
<li>Flow control mode
offers just the segmentation and flow control functions.

<li>Streaming mode
offers segmentation and receiver side packet flushing.

<p>
L2CAP is based around the concept of ’channels’. Each one of the endpoints of
an L2CAP channel is referred to by a <i>channel identifier (CID)</i>.

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> CHANNEL IDENTIFIERS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
A channel is a single sequence of packets, from and to a single pair of
services on a single device. Between two devices, there can be multiple channels active at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
A channel identifier (CID) is the local name representing a logical channel
endpoint on the device. The null identifier (0x0000) shall never be used as a
destination endpoint. Identifiers from 0x0001 to 0x003F are reserved for
specific L2CAP functions.At a minimum, the L2CAP Signaling channel (Fixed Channel 0x0001) or the
L2CAP LE Signaling channel (Fixed Channel 0x0005) shall be
supported. The Information Request / Response mechanism shall be used to determine which fixed channels a remote
device supports over the ACL-U logical link.
</p>

<p>
The characteristics of each fixed channel are defined on a per channel basis.
Fixed channel characteristics include configuration parameters (e.g., reliability,
MTU size, QoS), security, and the ability to change parameters using the
L2CAP configuration mechanism. Fixed channels shall only run over ACL-U, ASB-U, or
LE-U logical links and shall not be moved.
</p>

<p>
In Bluetooth low energy, only fixed channels are supported. Fixed channels don’t have any configuration
parameters to negotiate, and they exist as soon as the lower layers have established a connection;
consequently, there is no time wasted waiting for the channel to be
created. Only those fixed channels support connectionless model. 
</p>

<p>
for the remaining CIDs, two simultaneously active L2CAP channels
shall not share the same CID.

<p>
The L2CAP layer of the BLE Host Stack performs data multiplexing
through the use of a Channel ID (CID), which is a 2-byte value
contained by the L2CAP Basic Header, as seen in the general L2CAP
packet format: 
</p>


<figure>
<p><img src="./images/005.png" class="img-responsive" alt="005.png">
</p>
</figure>

<p>
Several CIDs are reserved. For instance, 0x0004 is used by the
ATT, 0x0006 by the SMP, 0x0005 is the Signaling Channel. The
0x0040-0x007F range is assigned for the Connection-Oriented
Channels.
</p>

<p>
The LE Credit-Based Flow Control is an L2CAP mode of operation
for Connection-Oriented Channels in which an endpoint device has
complete control over how many packets the peer device may send
at any time through the use of credits.
</p>

<p>
One credit represents the permission to send one LE-frame over
the established channel. The receiving device gives a fixed
number of credits to the sending device, so that the latter knows
exactly how many LE-frames it may send. The attempt to send more
frames than permitted results in the receiving device closing the
channel. 
</p>

<p>
An initial number of credits are given by each device to the peer
when the connection is created. Subsequently, each device can
give more credits as it deems necessary; if a device wants to
send more data than it is allowed, there’s nothing it can do but
wait until it receives more credits from the peer. 
</p>

<p>
A Protocol Service Multiplexer must be associated with any
credit-based connection. It is abbreviated as <code>LE_PSM</code> and is a
two-byte value identifying the protocol that uses the
credit-based connection. The specification defined the ranges for
allowed <code>LE_PSMs</code>; some are reserved by specific profiles
(e.g. IPSP) and others may be dynamically used by custom
application profiles.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>LE_PSM</code>

<li>LE Flow Control Credit

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CID
</li>

<li>Credits
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The requesting device must specify the LE<sub>PSM</sub> for which the
connection is opened, the CID to which the responder will send
data (SCID), the supported MTU and MPS and the initial number of
credits given to the responder. 
</p>

<p>
In turn, the responding device can reject the request (reason is
found in the Result parameter) or can accept it (Result is 0) and
also provide the CID where the requesting device can send data
(DCID), initial credits for this CID and its own MTU and MPS. 
</p>

<p>
The minimum values between the two devices’ MTU and MPS are
used. MTU is the maximum transmission unit, i.e. the maximum size
of data (an SDU – Service Data Unit) to be transmitted. MPS is
the maximum payload size, i.e. the maximum size of a single L2CAP
packet, which is an LE-frame and “eats” one credit when is
transmitted. 
</p>

<p>
At any moment, any of the two devices can send a Flow Control
Credit command to increase the credits of the peer on the given
CID.

<li><a id="sec-3-4-1-3" name="sec-3-4-1-3"></a>The data packets - example<br ><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-4-1-3">
<p>
Let’s assume device A sends an LE Credit-Based Connection Request
with:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>LE_PSM</code> = 0x0080
</li>
<li>SCID = 0x004a
</li>
<li>MTU = 100
</li>
<li>MPS = 40
</li>
<li>I.C. = 5
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Device B answers with an LE Credit-Based Connection Response:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DCID = 0x004b
</li>
<li>MTU =260
</li>
<li>MPS = 60
</li>
<li>I.C. = 10
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So MTU becomes 100 and MPS becomes 40. This means that a device
can send SDUs of maximum 100 bytes, but these 100 bytes will be
fragmented to fit into LE-frames of maximum 40 bytes payload. 
</p>

<p>
An LE-frame contains:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The basic L2CAP header: Length (2 bytes) and CID (2 bytes)
</li>
<li>Payload (length maximum equal to MPS)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When a large SDU is sent, the first LE-frame Payload starts with
2 bytes of SDU Length then follow the first MPS-2 bytes of
SDU. Subsequent LE-frames each contain MPS bytes of SDU, while
the last one may contain less than MPS bytes. 
</p>

<p>
If device A from our example wants to send an SDU of 90 bytes, it
would need 3 credits because the 90 bytes can be split in 3
LE-frames:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Each L2CAP packet contains a 32-bit header followed by its payload. It is assumed that segmentation
and reassembly is used; thus, the length of the packet must be included in the packet header so that the
end of the packet can be determined. The segmentation and reassembly scheme used requires the
marking of packets over the HCI interface. There is no way to denote that a given L2CAP packet segment is the end of the current packet. This
means that the only way to determine if the current packet is complete is to either send a new packet,
assuming that one is ready to be sent, or to include the packet
length in the very first packet sent.

<p>
For all Bluetooth Low Energy channels, the information payload
starts with a Maximum Transmission Units(MTU) size of 23 bytes. So
the Bluetooth Low Engergy devices must support a total Length of 27
bytes data.(4 + 23)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
The LE Signaling channel is used for Signaling at host layer. as
illustrated in the following figure, each LE Signaling packet
contains a single opcode, followed by any parameters. The following
command opcodes are supported on the LE Signaling channel:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Command Reject
</li>
<li>Connection Parameter Update Request
</li>
<li>Connection Parameter Update Response

</p>
<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 9:</span> The L2CAP command packet</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Whenever a signaling command is sent, an identifier is included in the information payload. This
identifier is just 1 byte in length and is used to match responses with requests.Identifiers can’t be reused unless all other identifiers have
been used. This leads implementations to use an increment operation
to ensure this rule is met. indentifier 0x0 is never used. 
</p>

<p>
In Bluetooth low energy, because only one request has been defined, and because this request can
only be sent when no other request is outstanding, the logic for
identifiers is very simple.
