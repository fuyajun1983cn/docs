#+TITLE: Base Band Controller


* Introduction
  
  The Baseband is the physical layer of the Bluetooth. It manages
  physical channels and links apart from other services like error
  correction, data whitening, hop selection and Bluetooth
  security. The Baseband layer lies on top of the Bluetooth radio
  layer in the bluetooth stack. The baseband protocol is implemented
  as a Link Controller  , which works with the link manager for
  carrying out link level routines like link connection and power
  control. The baseband also manages asynchronous and synchronous
  links, handles packets and does paging and inquiry to access and
  inquire Bluetooth devices in the area. The baseband transceiver
  applies a time-division duplex (TDD) scheme. (alternate transmit and
  receive). Therefore apart from different hopping frequency
  (frequency division), the time is also slotted. 

* Topology -- Piconet and Scatternet
  
  The Bluetooth system provides a point-to-point connection or a
  point-to-multipoint connection, Two or more devices sharing the same
  physical channel form a piconet.One Bluetooth device acts as the master of the piconet,
  whereas the other device(s) act as slave(s). Up to seven slaves can
  be active in a Piconet. The channel access is controlled by the
  master.

  Data is transmitted over the air in packets with two modes:
  
  - Basic Rate

    1Mbps

  - Enhanced Data Rate(Optional)

    2 ~ 3 Mbps


* Time Division Duplex

* Adaptive Frequency Hopping(AFH)

* Master, Slave Roles and Role Switch

* Channel, Transport and Links

* Packet Format

* Packet Types

* Link Controller States
