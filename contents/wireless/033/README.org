#+TITLE: PAN Profile

* Introduction

  The document describes how to use the Bluetooth Network
  Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) Specification to provide
  networking capabilities for Bluetooth devices.

  The PAN profile defines a means of enabling Bluetooth devices to
  participate in a personal area network. Completely un-modified
  Ethernet payloads can be transmitted using the Bluetooth Network
  Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) to exchange packets between Bluetooth
  devices.

  The profile defines how PAN is supported in the following
  situations.

  - Ad-hoc IP networking by two or more Bluetooth devices in a single
    piconet.

  - Network access for one or more Bluetooth devices.

* Profile overview
  
** Scenarios

   For this profile, three general scenarios are discussed:
 
   (1) Network access points,

   (2) Group Ad-hoc Networks, 

   (3) PANU-PANU. 

   Each of the scenarios has unique network architecture and unique
   network requirements, but all are various combinations of a PAN.

   
*** Network Access Points

    A network access point is a unit that contains one or more
    Bluetooth radio devices and acts as a bridge, proxy, or router
    between a Bluetooth network and some other network technology.

    Network access points SHALL provide access to other networks via
    technologies such as Ethenet, ISDN, Home PNA, Cable Modem and
    cellular. 

    
*** Group Ad-hoc Networks

    Group ad-hoc networking allows mobile hosts to cooperatively
    create ad-hoc wireless networks without the use of additional
    networking hardware or infrastructure.

*** PANU-PANU

    In this scenario, a point to point connection between two PANUs
    allows direct communication between these two nodes only.

** PAN Profile Scenarios summary

   The NAP role provides network services to each of the Bluetooth
   devices connected, while the GN role allows two or more Bluetooth
   devices to become part of an ad-hoc network. 

   Connecting to a Network Access Point or the formation of a Group
   Ad-hoc Network provide the facility for applications to use IP and
   other networking protocols. 

   Connections between two PANUs are used to simulate a cross-over
   cable between two nodes only.

   ME is the Management Entity which co-ordinates procedures during
   initialization, configuration and connection management.

** Configurations and roles

   The following roles are defined within the PAN profile.

   - Network Access Point (NAP) and NAP service

     The device with the NAP service forwards Ethernet packets between
     each of the connected Bluetooth devices, referred to as PAN
     users, see below. A device with the NAP service is simply
     referred to as a NAP. The NAP and the PAN User exchange data
     using the Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP)

   - Group Ad-hoc Network (GN) and GN service

     A Bluetooth device that supports the GN service is able to
     forward Ethernet packets to each of the connected Bluetooth
     devices, the PAN users, as needed. The Group Ad-hoc Network and
     the PAN User exchange data using the Bluetooth Network
     Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) 

     Group Ad-hoc Networks do not provide access to any additional
     networks. Instead, Group Ad-hoc Networks are intended to allow a
     group of devices to form temporary network and exchange
     information.

   - PAN User (PANU) and PANU service

     This is the Bluetooth device that uses either the NAP or the GN
     service. PANU supports the client role for both the NAP and GN
     roles, and direct PANU to PANU communication.
